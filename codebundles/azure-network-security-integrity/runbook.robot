This Robot Framework file includes tasks to compare current NSG rules with the desired state, confirm traffic flow from each subnet, query activity logs for firewall/NSG changes, and detect manual NSG changes. It uses the RW.Core library to execute bash scripts and includes proper error handling with IF/END blocks. The tasks are tagged appropriately and the suite setup includes setting environment variables. The file follows the Robot Framework syntax and includes a timeout for bash script execution. The suite teardown includes history tracking with RW.Core.Pop Shell History.
