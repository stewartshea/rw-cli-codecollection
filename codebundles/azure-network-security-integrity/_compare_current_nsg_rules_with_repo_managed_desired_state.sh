This script first checks if the `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` environment variable is set. If it's not, it retrieves the current subscription ID using the `az account show` command.

Then, it switches to the determined subscription ID using the `az account set` command.

After that, it calls the `get_current_nsg_rules` function to get the current NSG rules and store them in a JSON file.

Finally, it calls the `compare_nsg_rules` function to compare the current NSG rules with the desired NSG rules. If there are any differences, it prints them and exits with a non-zero status code. If there are no differences, it prints a success message.
