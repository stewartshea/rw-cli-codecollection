This script follows the best practices for writing shell scripts, including error handling, logging, validation, and use of meaningful variable names. It uses the Azure CLI to interact with the Azure platform, specifically to fetch the current Network Security Group (NSG) rules and compare them with the desired state. If the current and desired states do not match, the script logs an error message and exits with a non-zero status code.
