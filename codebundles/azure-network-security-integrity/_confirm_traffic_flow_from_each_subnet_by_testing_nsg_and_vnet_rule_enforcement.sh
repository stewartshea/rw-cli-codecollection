Here is a bash script that follows the requirements and patterns shown in the reference examples. This script checks the traffic flow from each subnet by testing NSG and VNet rule enforcement:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

# Define variables
SUBSCRIPTION_ID=${AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID:-}
VNET_NAME=${VNET_NAME:-}
NSG_NAME=${NSG_NAME:-}

# File to store any issues found
ISSUES_FILE="nsg_vnet_issues.json"
echo '[]' > "$ISSUES_FILE"

# Function to add issues to the issues file
add_issue() {
    local title="$1"
    local severity="$2"
    local details="$3"
    local next_steps="$4"
    details=$(echo "$details" | sed 's/"/\\"/g' | sed ':a;N;$!ba;s/\n/\\n/g')
    next_steps=$(echo "$next_steps" | sed 's/"/\\"/g' | sed ':a;N;$!ba;s/\n/\\n/g')
    echo "$(jq -n \
            --arg title "$title" \
            --arg severity "$severity" \
            --arg details "$details" \
            --arg next_steps "$next_steps" \
            '{title: $title, severity: $severity, details: $details, next_steps: $next_steps}' \
        )" >> "$ISSUES_FILE"
}

# Check if AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID is set, otherwise get the current subscription ID
if [ -z "$SUBSCRIPTION_ID" ]; then
    SUBSCRIPTION_ID=$(az account show --query "id" -o tsv)
    echo "AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID is not set. Using current subscription ID: $SUBSCRIPTION_ID"
else
    echo "Using specified subscription ID: $SUBSCRIPTION_ID"
fi

# Set the subscription to the determined ID
echo "Switching to subscription ID: $SUBSCRIPTION_ID"
az account set --subscription "$SUBSCRIPTION_ID"

# Get the list of subnets in the VNet
SUBNETS=$(az network vnet subnet list --resource-group "$RESOURCE_GROUP" --vnet-name "$VNET_NAME" --query "[].name" -o tsv)

# Loop through each subnet and test NSG and VNet rule enforcement
for SUBNET in $SUBNETS; do
    echo "Testing traffic flow for subnet: $SUBNET"
    RESULT=$(az network watcher test-ip-flow --direction Inbound --protocol Tcp --local "$SUBNET" --remote Internet --nsg "$NSG_NAME" --query "access" -o tsv)
    if [ "$RESULT" != "Allow" ]; then
        add_issue "Traffic flow issue for subnet: $SUBNET" "High" "Traffic flow from subnet $SUBNET is not allowed." "Check the NSG and VNet rules for this subnet."
    fi
done

# Check if any issues were found and exit with an appropriate code
if [ "$(jq '. | length' < "$ISSUES_FILE")" -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "Issues found. See $ISSUES_FILE for details."
    exit 1
else
    echo "No issues found."
    exit 0
fi
```

This script first checks if the `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` environment variable is set, and if not, it gets the current subscription ID. It then sets the subscription to the determined ID. It gets the list of subnets in the VNet and loops through each one, testing the NSG and VNet rule enforcement for each subnet. If any issues are found, they are added to the issues file. Finally, it checks if any issues were found and exits with an appropriate code.
