Here is a bash script that meets your requirements:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

# Define the output file for any issues found
ISSUES_FILE="network_security_issues.json"
echo '[]' > "$ISSUES_FILE"

# Function to add issues to the output file
add_issue() {
  local title="$1"
  local severity="$2"
  local details="$3"
  local next_steps="$4"
  details=$(echo "$details" | sed 's/"/\\"/g' | sed ':a;N;$!ba;s/\n/\\n/g')
  next_steps=$(echo "$next_steps" | sed 's/"/\\"/g' | sed ':a;N;$!ba;s/\n/\\n/g')
  echo "$(jq --arg title "$title" --arg severity "$severity" --arg details "$details" --arg next_steps "$next_steps" '. + [{title: $title, severity: $severity, details: $details, next_steps: $next_steps}]' "$ISSUES_FILE")" > "$ISSUES_FILE"
}

# Get or set subscription ID
if [[ -z "${AZURE_RESOURCE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID:-}" ]]; then
    subscription=$(az account show --query "id" -o tsv)
    echo "AZURE_RESOURCE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID is not set. Using current subscription ID: $subscription"
else
    subscription="$AZURE_RESOURCE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID"
    echo "Using specified subscription ID: $subscription"
fi

# Set the subscription to the determined ID
echo "Switching to subscription ID: $subscription"
az account set --subscription "$subscription"

# Get the list of all subnets
subnets=$(az network vnet subnet list --query "[].id" -o tsv)

# Loop over each subnet and test NSG and VNet rule enforcement
for subnet in $subnets; do
    echo "Testing traffic flow for subnet: $subnet"
    result=$(az network watcher flow-log show --location westus --name $subnet --query "flowAnalyticsConfiguration.networkWatcherFlowAnalyticsConfiguration.enabled" -o tsv)
    if [[ "$result" != "true" ]]; then
        add_issue "Traffic flow issue detected for subnet: $subnet" "High" "Traffic flow test failed for subnet: $subnet. NSG and VNet rule enforcement may not be working as expected." "Please check the NSG and VNet rules for this subnet and ensure they are configured correctly."
    fi
done

# Check if any issues were found
if [[ $(jq length "$ISSUES_FILE") -gt 0 ]]; then
    echo "Issues were found during the traffic flow tests. Please review the issues in the $ISSUES_FILE file."
    exit 1
else
    echo "No issues were found during the traffic flow tests."
    exit 0
fi
```

This script first sets the Azure subscription ID, then retrieves a list of all subnets. For each subnet, it tests the traffic flow by checking if the flow log is enabled. If the flow log is not enabled, it adds an issue to the output file. At the end, it checks if any issues were found and returns a meaningful exit code.
